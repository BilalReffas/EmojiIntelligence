I created a neural network entirely in Swift. This is a demo to demonstrate what is possible to solve.
<br>
I used the Playground on macOS. 
<br>
I believe in open source I think to push humanity forward you have to open source all the things \o/

### Neural Network Story

I used this challenge to learn more about neural networks and machine learning.
A neural network consists of layers, and each layer has neurons. My network has three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.

<br><br>
The input to my network has 64 binary numbers. These inputs are connected to the neurons in the hidden layer. The hidden layer performs some computation and passes the result to the output layer neuron out. This also performs a computation and then outputs a 0 or a 1. The input layer doesn‚Äôt actually do anything, they are just placeholders for the input value. Only the neurons in the hidden layer and the output layer perform computations.  The neurons from the input layer are connected to   the neurons in the hidden layer. Likewise, both neurons from the hidden layer are connected to the output layer. These kinds of layers are called fully-connected because every neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer. Each connection between two neurons has a weight, which is just a number. These weights form the brain of my network. For the activation function in my network, I use the sigmoid function. ![](http://i.imgur.com/Xrhx1wl.png)<br><br>
Sigmoid is a mathematical function. The sigmoid takes in some number x and converts it into a value between 0 and 1. That is ideal for my purposes, since I am dealing with binary numbers.
This will turn a linear equation into something that is non-linear. This is important because without this, the network wouldn‚Äôt be able to learn any interesting things. 

I have already mentioned that the input to this network are 64 binary numbers. I resize the drawn image to 8x8 pixels which makes together 64 pixels. I go through the image and check each pixel if the pixel has a pink color I add a 1 to my array else I add a 0. At the end I will have 64 binary numbers which I can add to my input layer. 

My main goal was to make neural network and machine learning more accessible and fun. As well to learn more about the powerful features of playgrounds and neural networks.
